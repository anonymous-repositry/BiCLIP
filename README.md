## 📌 Overview

BiCLIP (Bidirectional and Consistent Language-Image Processing) is a vision-language framework designed to improve robustness in medical image segmentatio. The method introduces:

- Bidirectional image-text alignment  
- Cross-modal consistency regularization  
- Robust multimodal representation learning  
- Improved generalization for medical downstream tasks  

Further methodological details are available in the submitted manuscript.
